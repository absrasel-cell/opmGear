## API Endpoints

The Page Builder uses several API endpoints for data management:

### Pages
- `GET /api/sanity/pages` - Fetch all pages
- `POST /api/sanity/pages` - Create a new page
- `GET /api/sanity/pages/[id]` - Fetch a specific page
- `PATCH /api/sanity/pages/[id]` - Update a page
- `DELETE /api/sanity/pages/[id]` - Delete a page

### Sections
- `GET /api/sanity/sections` - Fetch all sections
- `POST /api/sanity/sections` - Create a new section
- `POST /api/sanity/pages/[id]/sections` - Add section to page
- `DELETE /api/sanity/pages/[id]/sections/[index]` - Remove section from page
- `PATCH /api/sanity/pages/[id]/sections/reorder` - Reorder sections

## Sanity Schema

The Page Builder uses custom Sanity schemas for content management:

### Page Schema
```typescript
{
  _type: 'page',
  title: string,
  slug: { current: string },
  description?: string,
  isHomePage: boolean,
  isPublished: boolean,
  sections: Section[],
  seo: {
    metaTitle?: string,
    metaDescription?: string,
    ogImage?: image
  }
}
```

### Section Schemas
Each section type has its own schema with specific fields for that section's functionality.

## Customization

### Adding New Section Types

1. Create a new schema file in `src/sanity/schemaTypes/sections/`
2. Add the schema to `src/sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts`
3. Update the Page Builder component to handle the new section type
4. Add corresponding API endpoints if needed

### Styling Customization

The Page Builder uses Tailwind CSS classes. You can customize:
- Colors by modifying the color options in section schemas
- Layouts by adding new layout options
- Components by updating the UI components in `src/components/ui/`

## Best Practices

### Content Management
- Use descriptive page titles and URLs
- Write compelling headlines for sections
- Optimize images for web use
- Include relevant meta descriptions for SEO

### Performance

- Limit the number of sections per page
- Enable caching for published pages

### User Experience

- Ensure fast loading times
- Make navigation intuitive
- Use consistent styling across pages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Sections not saving**: Check your Sanity API token configuration
