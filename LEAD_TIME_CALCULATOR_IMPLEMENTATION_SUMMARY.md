# Professional Lead Time Calculator & Box Interface Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a Professional Grade Lead Time Calculator and Box interface in the support page's Order Builder section as requested. The implementation includes both backend calculation logic and frontend UI integration with the existing glass morphism design system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. API Endpoint
**File**: `src/app/api/support/lead-time-calculator/route.ts`
- Uses GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective AI processing
- Processes lead time calculation based on complex business rules
- Calculates professional box packaging requirements
- Returns structured JSON with lead time and packaging data

### 2. Frontend Integration
**File**: `src/app/support/page.tsx`
**Location**: Added after line 1361 (after Cost Breakdown section)

#### Key Features:
- **Conditional Display**: Only shows when `orderBuilderStatus.costBreakdown.available` is true
- **Auto-calculation**: Automatically calculates when a quote version is selected
- **Glass Morphism Design**: Follows existing design system with backdrop blur and gradients
- **Loading States**: Shows spinner during calculation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with fallback display

#### UI Components:
1. **Lead Time Display**:
   - Shows total days with delivery date
   - Lists breakdown of time components
   - Uses calendar and clock icons

2. **Box Calculator Display**:
   - Shows total number of boxes needed
   - Lists box types with dimensions
   - Displays net and chargeable weights
   - Uses archive box and scale icons

### 3. Data Flow
1. User selects a quote version in the Cost Breakdown section
2. `useEffect` triggers automatic lead time calculation
3. Quote data is extracted and sent to API endpoint
4. GPT-4o-mini processes the calculation logic
5. Results are displayed in the new UI section

### 4. Business Logic Implementation
Based on `src/app/ai/Lead time and Box calc.md`:

#### Lead Time Rules:
- Base time from leadTimeStr parsing (Blank vs Decorated)
- Logo complexity adders (TwoLogo/ThreeLogo +1 day, FourLogo +2 days)
- Delivery method adders (Regular/Priority different for Blank/Decorated)
- Quantity scaling (floor(totalQuantity/1000) Ã— 2 days)
- Color complexity (floor(lines.length / 2) days)
- Accessories/CapSetup complexity adders

#### Box Packaging Rules:
- Multiple box size options (24-200 pieces capacity)
- Special case handling (400/600/432 pieces)
- Volume and weight calculations
- Optimal box allocation algorithm

### 5. Integration Points
- **Data Source**: Uses selected quote version from `orderBuilderStatus.costBreakdown`
- **State Management**: New state for `leadTimeData` and `isCalculatingLeadTime`
- **Icons**: Added ArchiveBoxIcon, CalendarDaysIcon, ScaleIcon from Heroicons
- **Styling**: Uses existing Tailwind classes and glass morphism patterns

### 6. User Experience
- **Seamless Integration**: Appears naturally as part of the Order Builder flow
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states and error handling
- **Professional Presentation**: Clean, organized display of complex data
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design following existing patterns

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `src/app/api/support/lead-time-calculator/route.ts` - API endpoint
- `test-lead-time-api.js` - Test script for API validation

### Modified:
- `src/app/support/page.tsx` - Added UI component and integration logic

## Technical Specifications

### API Request Format:
```typescript
{
  leadTimeStr: string;
  logoSetup: string;
  deliveryType: string;
  totalQuantity: number;
  lines: Array<{color: string, size: string, quantity: number}>;
  accessoriesSelections: Array<any>;
  capSetupSelections: Array<any>;
  piecesPerBox: number;
  todayDate: string;
}
```

### API Response Format:
```typescript
{
  leadTime: {
    totalDays: number;
    deliveryDate: string;
    details: string[];
  },
  boxes: {
    lines: Array<{
      label: string;
      count: number;
      pieces: number;
      dimensions: string;
      volume: number;
    }>;
    totalBoxes: number;
    netWeightKg: number;
    chargeableWeightKg: number;
  }
}
```

## Testing
- API endpoint ready for testing with provided test script
- Frontend integration follows existing patterns
- Error handling implemented for robustness

## Next Steps
1. Test the implementation with the development server
2. Validate calculations with real quote data
3. Fine-tune styling if needed
4. Monitor performance with GPT-4o-mini usage

## Notes
- Uses the cheapest AI model (GPT-4o-mini) as requested
- Maintains compatibility with existing codebase
- Follows established coding patterns and style guidelines
- Integrates seamlessly with the existing Order Builder workflow
