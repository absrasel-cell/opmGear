# Return & Remake Policy

Effective Date: September 9, 2025

Legal Entity: US Custom Caps LLC ("US Custom Caps", "we", "us", or "our")

Address: 957 Hwy 85 Connector, Brooks, GA 30205, USA

This policy explains how returns, remakes, and refunds work for custom cap orders. Because your order is made-to-spec, most returns are limited to defects or mismatches from the Approved Sample described below.

## 1) Key Definitions

- Quote: A written estimate detailing product, quantity, pricing, and scope.
- Mockup: A graphical representation showing artwork placement, colors, and notes.
- Physical Sample: A real cap made to the agreed specifications for final approval before bulk production. Optional paid service: $150 (includes production and shipping of the sample package; rush/expedited shipping may be extra).
- Approved Sample: The version you approve (either a Sample Image we provide or the Physical Sample you receive). This is the controlling reference for bulk production.

## 2) Our Standard Process

1. Request & Quote: You submit a request via web form or email; we provide a Quote.
2. Design & Mockup: We prepare a detailed Mockup with fabric, color, logo position/size, stitching, trims, and any labels.
3. Compulsory Sample for Final Approval:
   - Sample Image Approval: We send high‑resolution photos or videos of your sample for approval.
   - Physical Sample Approval (Optional): We ship a Physical Sample for in‑hand review and approval for an additional $150.
4. Final Approval: You provide written approval referencing the sample (image or physical). This creates the Approved Sample.
5. Bulk Production: We manufacture the order to match the Approved Sample.
6. Delivery: We ship finished goods to the agreed address.

## 3) Your Approval Responsibilities

- Accuracy: Carefully review all details before approving: fabric type, color(s), Pantone or thread codes, logo artwork, size, placement, stitch type, trims, labels/tags, and packaging.
- Color Guidance: When color accuracy is critical, provide Pantone references or approved swatches. Screens can display colors differently; Pantone values and in‑hand physical approval provide the best accuracy.
- Written Approval: We require an explicit written "Approved" confirmation by email or via portal, identifying the specific sample (image or physical) and date.

## 4) Our Commitment — Exact Match to the Approved Sample

- Production Guarantee: Your bulk order will match the Approved Sample. If any material aspect of Fabric, Color, or Logos (artwork, size, placement, or stitch color) does not match the Approved Sample, you are eligible to request a Remake or Refund as outlined below.
- What "Match" Means: We follow the approved materials, artwork files, placements, and instructions that the sample demonstrates, including Pantone or thread color references when provided.

## 5) What Qualifies for a Remake or Refund

Eligible issues (must be compared against the Approved Sample):
- Fabric: Wrong fabric type, texture, or construction relative to the Approved Sample.
- Color: Fabric color or stitch color does not match the Approved Sample (including agreed Pantone/thread references if specified).
- Logos/Artwork: Wrong artwork, incorrect size, incorrect placement, missing elements, or incorrect stitch type/technique versus the Approved Sample.
- Trims/Details: Wrong closures, patches, labels, or trims that differ from the Approved Sample.

Remedies we provide (one of the following, at your choice when justified):
- Remake: We remake affected pieces to match the Approved Sample.
- Refund: We refund the affected pieces (full or partial depending on scope of the issue).

## 6) What Does Not Qualify

- Changes After Approval: Requests to change specifications after final approval but before or during bulk production are treated as a new order and may incur additional costs and time.
- Wear & Tear: Damage or issues arising from use, handling, or storage after delivery.
- Size Fit Preference: Cap fit preferences that were not specified and approved in the sample stage.
- Minor Handling Marks: Minor wrinkles or handling marks from shipping that recover with light steaming or rest.
- Customer‑Provided Artwork Issues: Low‑resolution art or constraints you accepted at approval time.

Note: If you approved a Sample Image (not a Physical Sample), color perception differences between screens can occur. When Pantone or thread codes were provided and matched, we assess against those codes and the Approved Sample photograph. If you require absolute color certainty, select the Physical Sample option.

## 7) Claim Window & Evidence Required

- Timing: Notify us within 7 calendar days of delivery.
- How to File: Email support@uscustomcaps.com with subject line: "Return/Remake Request – Order #____".
- Include:
  - Order number and contact info
  - Clear photos or video showing the issue compared to the Approved Sample image (and Pantone/thread codes if relevant)
  - A description of the mismatch (fabric, color, logo/artwork, placement, size, trims)
- Keep Products: Retain all items and packaging until your claim is resolved. We may provide a prepaid return label when a return is required for inspection.

## 8) Inspection & Resolution

- Review: We review your evidence against the Approved Sample. We may request additional photos or a return for physical inspection.
- Decision: If a mismatch is confirmed, we will offer a Remake or Refund for the affected quantities. If part of the order matches and part does not, remedies apply to the affected portion.
- Timing: We aim to provide a resolution within 5–7 business days after receiving all required information (and returned goods, if requested).

## 9) Shipping Damage or Loss

- Damage in Transit: Report visible shipping damage to the carrier upon receipt and notify us within 48 hours with photos. We will assist with a carrier claim and replacement/remake as needed.
- Lost Shipments: If tracking shows lost in transit, we will work with the carrier to resolve and arrange replacement where confirmed.

## 10) Order Changes & Cancellations

- Before Sampling: Orders canceled before we begin sample production are refundable except for any incurred design or setup work.
- After Sampling Begins: The $150 Physical Sample fee and any sampling work already performed are non‑refundable.
- After Final Approval: Once bulk production has started, orders cannot be canceled or refunded except as provided under this policy for confirmed mismatches to the Approved Sample.

## 11) Returns Logistics

- RMA: If a return is required, we will issue an RMA number and provide a prepaid label (in confirmed mismatch or defect cases).
- Condition: Returned items must be unworn and unwashed and include all packaging/accessories.
- Title & Risk: Title and risk for returned goods pass to us upon carrier scan of the return label we provide.

## 12) Limitations

- Custom Goods: Except for confirmed mismatches to the Approved Sample or manufacturing defects, custom goods are not eligible for return or refund.
- Indirect Loss: We are not responsible for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (e.g., missed events) unless required by law.
- Maximum Remedy: Limited to remake or refund of the affected items and applicable shipping fees in confirmed cases.
