ðŸŽ¯ US CUSTOM CAP - MCP SERVER CREATION PLAN
================================================

OVERVIEW:
Create an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes your existing Advanced Product page APIs as structured tools for AI assistants to interact with your e-commerce platform.

WHAT IS MCP?
- Protocol that allows AI assistants to interact with external systems
- Provides structured tools/functions that AI can call
- Enables real-time data access and operations
- Works with Claude, OpenAI GPT, and other AI models

YOUR CURRENT API ASSETS (76+ endpoints):
âœ… Product Management (Sanity/Webflow integration)
âœ… Order Management (Create, Track, Update)
âœ… Cart Operations (Add, Update, Remove)
âœ… Pricing Calculations (Tier-based, Volume discounts)
âœ… User Management (Auth, Profiles, Roles)
âœ… Support System (AI-powered conversations)
âœ… Inventory Management
âœ… Shipment Tracking
âœ… Invoice Generation
âœ… Analytics & Metrics

TARGET OUTCOME:
AI assistants can:
- Browse your product catalog
- Calculate pricing for custom configurations
- Create and manage orders
- Track shipments
- Access customer support
- Generate quotes and invoices
- Perform admin operations (with proper permissions)

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
1. Create MCP server using TypeScript/Node.js
2. Expose existing APIs as MCP tools/resources
3. Add authentication/authorization layer
4. Include rate limiting and error handling
5. Provide comprehensive documentation
6. Test with Claude Code and other AI assistants

ESTIMATED TIMELINE: 2-3 weeks
COMPLEXITY: Medium-High (due to comprehensive API surface)
BENEFITS:
