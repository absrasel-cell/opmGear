# Logo Upload & Instructions System Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Logo Upload and Additional Instructions system for the OPM Gear e-commerce platform. The system allows customers to upload logo files and provide instructions during product customization, with full integration into Member and Admin dashboards.

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### 1. Database Architecture
- **New Model**: `OrderAsset` - Stores file metadata and relationships
- **Updated Model**: `Order` - Added `additionalInstruction` field
- **Enums**: `AssetKind` (LOGO, ACCESSORY, OTHER)
- **Migration**: Applied successfully to PostgreSQL database

```prisma
model OrderAsset {
  id             String       @id @default(cuid())
  orderId        String
  userId         String
  kind           AssetKind
  position       String?
  bucket         String       // "order-assets"
  path           String       // "orderId/uuid-filename.ext"
  mimeType       String
  sizeBytes      Int
  width          Int?
  height         Int?
  checksum       String?
  uploadedAt     DateTime     @default(now())
  order          Order        @relation(fields: [orderId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}
```

### 2. API Endpoints
All endpoints include authentication checks and proper authorization:

- **POST** `/api/orders/[orderId]/assets/initiate` - Generate signed upload URLs
- **POST** `/api/orders/[orderId]/assets/commit` - Finalize uploads to database
- **GET** `/api/orders/[orderId]/assets` - Retrieve assets with signed download URLs
- **DELETE** `/api/orders/[orderId]/assets/[assetId]` - Remove assets
- **PATCH** `/api/orders/[orderId]/instruction` - Update additional instructions

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Product Page Integration
- **LogoUploader**: Multi-file drag & drop uploader with progress tracking
- **AdditionalInstructionInput**: Rich text input with auto-save functionality
- **Visibility Control**: Only shows when Logo or Accessories options are selected

#### Member Dashboard
- **LogoAssetsDisplay**: View uploaded files with download links
- **File Previews**: Image thumbnails and file type icons
- **Instructions Display**: Read-only view of additional instructions

#### Admin Dashboard
- **AdminLogoAssetsDisplay**: Enhanced version with admin controls
- **Position Editing**: Inline editing of file positions
- **File Management**: Delete files, copy download links
- **Admin Controls**: Additional management capabilities

### 4. Security & Access Control

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Owner Access**: Users can only access their own order assets
- **Admin Access**: Super admins and master admins have full access
- **Session Validation**: All endpoints require valid authentication

#### File Security
- **Supabase Storage**: Files stored in `order-assets` bucket with RLS policies
- **Signed URLs**: Temporary download links (30-minute expiry)
- **File Validation**: Type, size, and count limits enforced

#### Data Validation
- **File Types**: PNG, JPEG, WebP, SVG, PDF only
- **File Size**: 20MB per file limit
- **File Count**: Maximum 5 files per order
- **Instructions**: 500 character limit with XSS protection

### 5. File Management System

#### Upload Process
1. **Initiate**: Client requests signed upload URLs from server
2. **Upload**: Direct upload to Supabase storage via signed URLs
3. **Commit**: Server verifies uploads and creates database records
4. **Optimistic UI**: Real-time progress and status updates

#### Storage Structure
```
order-assets/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [orderId]/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [uuid]-slugified-filename.ext
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [uuid]-another-file.ext
```

#### Metadata Tracking
- File dimensions (for images)
- MIME types and validation
- Upload timestamps
- Position assignments
- File integrity (optional checksums)

### 6. User Experience Features

#### Upload Interface
- **Drag & Drop**: Modern file drop zone
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and validation
- **File Previews**: Thumbnail generation for images
- **Position Assignment**: Dropdown to assign logo positions

#### Dashboard Integration
- **File Cards**: Clean, organized display of uploaded files
- **Download Management**: One-click downloads with proper filenames
- **Preview Functionality**: Quick image preview in new tabs
- **Status Indicators**: Clear upload status and file information

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- **Prisma ORM** for database operations
- **Zod** for request/response validation
- **NextAuth.js** for session management

### Storage & Database
- **Supabase Storage** for file storage with RLS policies
- **PostgreSQL** for relational data
- **Row Level Security** for data access control

## üöÄ Integration Points

### Product Customization Page
Located in `/customize/[slug]`, the upload components appear after the Cost Calculator when Logo or Accessories options are selected. Integration includes:

- Dynamic position detection from logo selections
- Real-time cost updates
