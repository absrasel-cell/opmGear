## 🔄 Migration Strategy Used

### **1. Component-First Approach**
- Created UI components first to establish the interface layer
- Gradually extracted business logic into services
- Maintained clear separation between UI and business logic

### **2. Service Layer Pattern**
- Extracted complex business logic into dedicated service classes
- Made services stateless and pure function-based where possible
- Provided clear interfaces for service consumption

### **3. Custom Hooks Pattern**
- Used custom hooks to manage component state and side effects
- Encapsulated related state management logic together
- Made hooks reusable across different components

### **4. Incremental Migration**
- Migrated functionality in phases to maintain working application
- Tested each phase before proceeding to the next
- Preserved all original functionality throughout the process
