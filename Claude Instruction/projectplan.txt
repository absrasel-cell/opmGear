Project Completion: 96% (Version 3.3.0)

CONFIRMED APPROACH: Copy-Paste Dashboard Strategy

Phase 1: Multi-Vendor Marketplace Expansion (3 weeks, 45-55 hours)

Week 1 - Admin Dashboard Optimization (15 hours):
✓ Perfect existing admin dashboard performance and UI
✓ Optimize statistics display and product management
✓ Clean up code patterns for copying
✓ Document reusable components

Week 2 - Wholesale Dashboard Creation (20 hours):
- Copy admin structure: cp -r dashboard/admin/* dashboard/wholesale/
- Remove admin features: user management, system settings
- Add wholesale features: volume pricing, bulk ordering, supplier catalog
- Customize navigation and routing

Week 3 - Supplier Dashboard + Integration (15-20 hours):
- Copy admin structure: cp -r dashboard/admin/* dashboard/supplier/
- Add supplier features: product upload, inventory management, order fulfillment
- Update Sidebar.tsx routing logic for role-based navigation
- Store page enhancement with advanced filtering
- Testing: role-based access, feature isolation, security validation

Directory Structure:
src/app/dashboard/
├── admin/          # Master dashboard (source template)
├── wholesale/      # Copied from admin, wholesale-specific
├── supplier/       # Copied from admin, supplier-specific
└── member/         # Existing member dashboard

Routing Logic Update:
- Admin: Full system control (MASTER_ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN, STAFF)
- Wholesale: Volume pricing & bulk orders (customerRole: WHOLESALE)
- Supplier: Product management & fulfillment (customerRole: SUPPLIER)
- Member: Basic functionality (customerRole: RETAIL)

Next Priority: Start with Week 1 - Admin dashboard optimization
