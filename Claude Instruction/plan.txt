next steps:

creating separate Dashboard page for "Supplier"
1) I will copy the Admin dashboard, and remove Admin level features from it, allow them to upload their products and sell into my Platform.
2) Their products will be visible into a seperated Store page and Product page, which will be more simpler/for inventory products, and for customized cap products, we can use the existing one.
3) "Resale" members, will be able to access some additional Sidebar button within their dashboards.
4) Need to work with Store Page and the Filters.
5) Generate Order invoice at Checkout. 
6) Work on Billing & Accounts page for final implementation of pricing as Resale side.
7) further testing on how Orders are being saved, if it matches all data with dashboard and input.


in vercel, https://opm-gear-r6ljt79qw-absrasel-cells-projects.vercel.app/dashboard/admin/products show all the product that Admin created, but in "https://opm-gear-r6ljt79qw-absrasel-cells-projects.vercel.app/store" no products are loading. I connected API keys for everything correctly in vercel, there are no issue with authentication, supabase working fine, sanity working fine because it is in sync with my localhost, correctly showing all created products in Admin dashboard.
 Store is working fine from localhost.
 
 working on "Product Management" from Admin dashboard, for "Resale Products" only:

1) Fix UI to match with the existing setup for "Inventory Information" Form block.
2) in Supplier Information: include profile photo, their profile photo will be visible as Brand Image at "Store Page"
3) add Category/Tag, input field that will represent as Filter that used in Store Page.

** update the interface of Cap Color option. Keeping the existing multi images upload with text (color name) input feature, I would like to include antoher way to put Color option, similar to "custom Category" just by typing the color names with comma, and later they could upload image if they want.

** include another way to refer to an existing "Factory Products" , that has all color options, by using it's field "Front Color Images".

** If the "Product Readiness", unchecks "Customizable", hide/collapse "Custom Option Categories". 

** change text color for "Main Image *", "Stock/Inventory", "Customizable", so that they are better visible on dark background.

Implement "Cap Style Setup" Dropdown names and choices in Product Management for both Factory Products, and Resale Products: 

1) "Bill Shape" - choices "Slight Curved", "Curved", "Flat"
2) "Profile" - choices "High", "Mid", "Low"
3) "Closure Type" - choices "Snapback", "Velcro", "Fitted", "Stretched"
4) "Structure" - choices "Structured", "Unstructured", "Foam"
5) Fabric Setup - option list are as below:
Chino Twill/Trucker Mesh
Chino Twill
Cotton Polyester Mix
Acrylic
Polyester
Ripstop
Denim
Suede Cotton
Genuine Leather
PU Leather
Camo
Spandex
Cotton Corduroy
Ribbed Corduroy
Polyester 97% Spandex 3%
100% Polyester Jersey
Canvas
Cotton Polyester Mix/Trucker Mesh
Chino Twill/Air Mesh
Cotton Polyester Mix/Air Mesh
Polyester/Laser Cut
Cotton Polyester Mix/Laser Cut
let user add "Other" and type their custom fabric setup.

for the Fabric setup option, show the option data around Product Description box, note that Fabric setup are also considered as Customization option. thus if any option value matches with "\src\app\csv\Customization Pricings.csv" will add cost as "Premium Fabric Cost" at Cost Calculation Section.

Make sure these new dropdown elements are well planned and placed for easy, smooth and informative UI at product management page.

whole product page UI is now messed up. Premium Fabric Options holding the full 2nd column. it would be best
   if you could place it under Cap Style Setup. also, Premium Fabric is not showing the full fabric setup 
  list, "Chino Twill/Trucker Mesh
  Chino Twill
  Cotton Polyester Mix
  Acrylic
  Polyester
  Ripstop
  Denim
  Suede Cotton
  Genuine Leather
  PU Leather
  Camo
  Spandex
  Cotton Corduroy
  Ribbed Corduroy
  Polyester 97% Spandex 3%
  100% Polyester Jersey
  Canvas
  Cotton Polyester Mix/Trucker Mesh
  Chino Twill/Air Mesh
  Cotton Polyester Mix/Air Mesh
  Polyester/Laser Cut
  Cotton Polyester Mix/Laser Cut
  let user add "Other" and type their custom fabric setup." here as example if a fabric setup has Two fabric 
  name like "Polyester/Laser Cut" mean, Polyester will be used on front and Laser cut fabric will be used on 
  Back side. Single Fabric names like "Chino Twill", mean full cap is chino twill. if any fabric name is 
  present in either single or double fabric names, PRemium price will be included and I expect New Premium 
  Fabric dropdown to autoselect as per set Fabric setup from Prodcut Management.
