use your best agent:

 /support page, i want the "Conversation History" sidebar is not showing any previous conversation.

 to be expand since Page load, and match with the page UI glass design and color. i wanted it to store each conversation, each conversation should store with title of the Quote Order, or with the Type of Question user asked, similar to how Ai service websites does. the "Order Builder" section will also be saved with the conversation's data or submitted Quote. to generate Conversation title, use gpt3o or something to quick generate or update the conversation titles.
  Conversation History still showing this ?
