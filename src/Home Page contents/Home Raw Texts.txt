Our Mission

Empowering Identity, Fueling Communities

At OPM Gear, our mission is to empower schools, teams, and communities with full control over how they represent themselves—on and off the field. We believe every group deserves access to high-quality, custom headwear that reflects their identity, supports their goals, and strengthens their connection with fans, families, and sponsors.

We’ve eliminated the traditional barriers set by big-box brands by offering a fully customizable platform where customers can design their own caps, set up fundraising initiatives, and take ownership of their merchandise. From students and athletes to parents and alumni, our tools make it easy to create gear that not only looks great but gives back.

Each cap becomes more than apparel—it becomes a statement of pride, a source of revenue, and a meaningful symbol of unity. With every order, we’re helping communities raise funds, lower costs for young athletes, and build a brand that’s truly theirs.

Our Vision

Reimagining Custom Gear for the Next Generation

At OPM Gear, our vision is to redefine how athletic programs and communities build identity, generate revenue, and foster connection—starting with a cap. We believe custom gear should do more than complete a uniform; it should empower teams to fund their future and fuel long-term impact.

We envision a world where every school, club, and organization—regardless of size or budget—can access fully branded, retail-grade headwear without relying on traditional manufacturers or inflated markups. By removing middlemen, we’ve created a direct path between creators and communities.

Our goal is to sell 5 million hats within five years, unlocking a scalable fundraising model that puts money back into the hands of the people who need it most. Through digital-first tools, sustainable production, and flexible customization, we’re giving teams the ability to design, distribute, and profit from their gear—without sacrificing quality or control.

We’re not just building caps—we’re building a platform for ownership, equity, and pride in every stitch.


Our Impact

Every Cap Sold Supports the Future of Youth Sports

At OPM Gear, impact isn’t an afterthought — it’s built into every stitch. Each cap sold helps bridge the financial gap for athletic programs by reinvesting a portion of every sale directly back into the schools, teams, and organizations behind the design.

Whether you're a coach outfitting a roster, a student launching a team fundraiser, or a parent supporting your child’s passion, your purchase contributes to more than just gear — it funds travel, uniforms, tournament fees, and essential resources that would otherwise strain annual budgets.

We handle everything from production to logistics, ensuring that supporters can focus on building their programs and uniting their communities. By turning custom headwear into a fundraising engine, we’re helping teams grow their brand, empower their players, and create a legacy that lasts far beyond the season.
