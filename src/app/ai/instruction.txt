Product build path is, Blank Cap (compulsory) + Customization (optional) + Delivery (compulsory) = Total selling cost.

Blank cap data found in, "\USCC\src\app\ai\Blank Cap" the csv files, Customer Products.csv, and "priceTier.csv".

Customer Products.csv has all basic information of our Cap products in format of column headers:
"Name" as Product Name, 
"Profile", as Cap Profile; High, Mid, Low 
"Bill Shape", as Cap Bill Shape; Flat, Slight Curved, Curved
"Panel Count", as Number of Panel Count, 4-Panel, 5-Panel, 6-Panel, 7-Panel
"priceTier", to match cost of the product having value (Tier 1 or Tier 2, etc) match at "\src\app\ai\Blank Cap\priceTier.csv".
"Structure", for Cap Structure Type; Structured, Unstructured, Foam

Product Options and Add-On/Customization are found in "\USCC\src\app\ai\Options"
Where I have placed csv for individual type of options:
 1) Size.csv: use column "Brand", "Hat Size", "Head Circumference", "Size", "Sarcastic Size Name" as reference, to confirm Cap Size option with Customer. Default Size is: Medium
 2) Colors.csv: I have only placed Single color names. Customers are allowed to use upto 3 colors. Explanation: if Single color like "Black", full cap is Black. If 2 colors, Black/White, then Cap's Upper Bill, Under Bill, Front Part, Button are Black, and Cap's Side, Back, Closure are White. If 3 colors, "Black/Charcoal/Grey", then, Upper Bill, Under Bill, Button are "Black", Front is "Charcoal", Back and Closure is "Grey". "Camo" colors will be considered as "Camo" Fabric, which adds cost. 

ðŸ”´ CRITICAL COLOR EXTRACTION NOTE: When analyzing PDF artwork files, preserve EXACT color names including multi-word colors like "Light Grey", "Dark Grey", "Light Blue", "Carolina Blue", "Kelly Green", "Dark Green", "Burnt Orange", "Light Khaki", "Amber Gold", "Charcoal Grey". DO NOT truncate or substitute similar colors - "Light Grey" is NOT "Black". 
 3) Logo.csv: all option names are in "Name" columns, Full Logo Customization option name looks like this "Large 3D Embroidery Direct" or "Large 3D Embroidery", means, Size + Name + Application makes a full customization name, where "Direct"  is not used mostly because each Logo names represent Direct Application unless they are "Patches" applied on any Logo types by "Run" or "Satin" embroidery above the . Look at "Mold Charge" column, where the flat mold charge will add with the Logo option (only Leather and Rubber Patches). 
 Default for Front Location: Large 3D Embroidery, for Left, Right, Back: Small Flat Embroidery, for Upper Bill: Medium Flat Embroidery, for under Bill: Large Sublimated Print.
 
 4) Accessories.csv, simply collect costs per quantity.
 5) Closure.csv, has Free types that are included with Blank Cap price, and Premium Closure type. default: is "Snapback". 
 6) Fabric.csv, maxium allowed fabrc type per cap is "2", example; Chino Twill/ Trucker Mesh, Upperbill, Under bill, Front, Button is Chino Twill, and Sides, Back is Trucker Mesh. column "costType" that are "Free" are included with Blank cap price, "Premium Fabric" will add cost. Column "Color Note", that has "All" are supported by "Color.csv" options.  Default option: Chino Twill as Solid, Chino Twill/Trucker Mesh, as Double fabric Setup.
 7) Delivery: use all columns for reference intelligently. Air Freight, Sea Freight is not supported unless minimum order is 3000 pieces.
